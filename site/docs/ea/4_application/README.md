This project only populates document 2: it's four static pages with no
interchangeable adapters, no interfaces, and a service-to-component
mapping trivial enough to state inline in that one document instead of a
separate services document.

## Layer view

The service, its six components and the one thing they share are drawn in
[2_application-components.md](./2_application-components.md).

See [2_application-components.md](./2_application-components.md) for the
service each component realizes and its exact source file.
