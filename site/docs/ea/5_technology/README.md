# Technology Layer

_[← EA home](../README.md)_

The runtime and pipeline that the
[application layer](../4_application/README.md) executes on. Chosen using
the `stack-selection` skill's "no backend" decision path — this is a
static site with no shared mutable state, so it takes the cheapest,
simplest option: static files, static hosting.
