# Strategy & Motivation Layer

_[← EA home](../README.md)_

The top-down business context: who has a stake in this project, why it
exists, which capabilities it needs, and the value stream it delivers.

Document 2 is not written for this project — a guidance site is small

document 3; nothing here would say more than that. See the parent
template's application-layer README for the same "not every project needs
every numbered file" rule.
