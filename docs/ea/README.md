# Enterprise Architecture — <Project Name>

_[← Repository README](../../README.md) · [Scope documents](../scope/README.md)_

This folder is the **primary documentation of the system**, organized as an
ArchiMate-layered enterprise architecture. Every element is grounded in the
implemented solution: entries name the page, module, or pipeline file that
realizes them (or are marked explicitly **"Pending — future initiative"**),
so the architecture can be verified against the code at any time.

Folders and files carry a numeric prefix giving the order in which they are
assessed. **Any change in requirements is aligned through these layers in
this order — strategy first, technology last — and captured in a
[scope document](../scope/README.md) before implementation starts** (see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the `ea-first-change` skill in
`.claude/skills/`).

## Layers, in assessment order

| #   | Layer                                       | ArchiMate viewpoint      | Answers                                                                       |
| --- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0   | [0_business-design/](./0_business-design/README.md) | _none — business design input_ | Who are the customers, what do they need, and how does each offering pay? |
| 1   | [1_strategy/](./1_strategy/README.md)       | Motivation + Strategy    | Why does this exist? Who cares? What capabilities and value stream?           |
| 2   | [2_business/](./2_business/README.md)       | Business layer           | Who does what? Which services are offered, through which processes?          |
| 3   | [3_information/](./3_information/README.md) | Passive structure (data) | What information exists, where does it live, how does it flow?               |
| 4   | [4_application/](./4_application/README.md) | Application layer        | Which software services and components realize the business services?       |
| 5   | [5_technology/](./5_technology/README.md)   | Technology layer         | What runs it all — runtimes, tooling, build, hosting, deployment?            |

Layer `0` is the odd one out: it holds no ArchiMate elements at all, only
the Value Proposition and Business Model canvases the architecture is
**derived** from. It is filled in only when the initiative is modeling an
organization rather than building a single application — see
[0_business-design/](./0_business-design/README.md), which carries the
block-by-block mapping into layers 1 and 2. An application project leaves
the folder empty and starts at layer 1.

Files inside each layer folder are numbered the same way; each layer README
explains its own analysis order. Delivered initiatives (ArchiMate
Implementation & Migration viewpoint) are documented per initiative in
[../scope/](../scope/README.md), not here — the EA describes the **current**
(or **target**, while unimplemented) state; scope documents describe the
**changes** that produce it.

## Notation conventions

ArchiMate has no native Mermaid profile, so these documents encode ArchiMate
semantics onto Mermaid flowcharts with two rules:

1. **Element type as a «stereotype»** in the first line of each node label,
   e.g. `«Business Service»`, `«Application Component»`, `«Data Object»`.
2. **Layer color** via a `classDef` per layer, approximating the standard
   ArchiMate palette:

| Layer                      | class            | Fill             |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Motivation                  | `motivation`     | violet `#e6d6f5` |
| Strategy                    | `strategy`       | sand `#f5deaa`   |
| Business                    | `business`       | yellow `#fffbb5` |
| Application                 | `application`    | cyan `#c2f0ff`   |
| Technology                  | `technology`     | green `#c9e7b7`  |
| Implementation & Migration  | `implementation` | rose `#ffd6d6`   |

This table is the **single source** for the layer palette; the `ea-doc-style`
skill and every other document point here for the exact fills. Mermaid
`classDef` blocks necessarily inline these hexes per diagram (Mermaid has no
cross-file classDef), but no other prose table restates them.

Relationships are labeled with their ArchiMate name: **serves**,
**realizes**, **assigned to**, **accesses**, **triggers**, **flow**,
**aggregates**, **influences**. Where Mermaid arrowheads can't distinguish
relation types, the label is authoritative.

<!--
  If this project documents in a language other than English, keep a
  stereotype-correspondence table here (translated label → standard
  ArchiMate element name) so the vocabulary stays traceable. See the
  ea-doc-style skill.

## Layered overview

<!--
  TEMPLATE — replace with the project's real stakeholders, goal, value
  stream, business service(s), application component(s), and technology
  node(s) once they're known. Keep the shape (one subgraph per layer, a
  classDef per layer, ArchiMate relationship labels on the edges).
-->

## Reading order

Top-down (recommended for newcomers — the same order as the folder numbers).
If the project modeled an organization, start one step earlier, at
[0_business-design/1_value-proposition-canvas.md](./0_business-design/1_value-proposition-canvas.md)
→ [0_business-design/2_business-model-canvas.md](./0_business-design/2_business-model-canvas.md),
and read the strategy layer as their consequence:
[1_strategy/1_motivation.md](./1_strategy/1_motivation.md)
→ [1_strategy/3_value-stream.md](./1_strategy/3_value-stream.md)
→ [2_business/2_business-services.md](./2_business/2_business-services.md)
→ [3_information/1_data-objects.md](./3_information/1_data-objects.md)
→ [4_application/2_application-components.md](./4_application/2_application-components.md)
→ [5_technology/2_deployment.md](./5_technology/2_deployment.md).

Bottom-up (for developers verifying alignment): start from
[4_application/2_application-components.md](./4_application/2_application-components.md),
which links each component to its source file, then trace upward via the
"realizes" relationships.
