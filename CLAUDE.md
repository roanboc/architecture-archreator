<!--
  TEMPLATE — replace this comment block and the placeholders below when you

<One or two sentences: what this project is, what state it's in.>

## The rule that governs everything else

**Strategy and business architecture are validated before any other
layer, and the requester approves at explicit gates before development.**
A change in requirements is never coded directly: align it through the
numbered EA layers (`docs/ea/1_strategy` → … → `5_technology`), stop at
the gates for the requester's approval, record it all in a scope document
(`docs/scope/`), then implement. Use the `ea-first-change` skill for the
process (it defines the gates), `strategy-discovery` when the strategy is
still unfilled or the change shifts it, `scope-doc` for the scope document
(its Approvals table is the durable record of the gates), `ea-doc-style`
when touching anything under `docs/`, and `pr-description` when opening or
updating a PR (the body must cover the whole branch, not just the latest
commit). Pure bug fixes that change no documented behavior can skip the
alignment and the gates, but still keep the docs true.

## Layout

<!-- Replace with the real source layout once the project has code, e.g.:
- `src/` — ...
- `tests/` — ...
-->

- `docs/ea/` — the documentation home (numbered ArchiMate layers);
  `docs/scope/` — one document per initiative.

## Commands

<!-- Replace with the project's real commands once they exist, e.g.:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```
All of them must be green before pushing; CI runs the same.
-->

## Conventions

<!-- Project-specific conventions go here as they're established —
     glossary location, code language, naming rules, single point of
     enforcement for business rules, etc. Keep this section short; link to
     the EA docs for anything that has a canonical home there instead of
     restating it. -->
